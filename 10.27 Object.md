# Object 
## Object = Property + Method
- Object can be defined as a bowl that contains diverse functions to control data.

## New operator
- Reproducing an object is creating "instance"
- To make an object as an instance, we use "new" operator

``` javascript
var obj = new nObj([...])
```
## Constructor
- When initializing an object, there must be method that has the same name as the object. This initialization method is called "constructor"
- A created instance is stored at a variable. Then, the variable can be considered as an object. The variable can be called as "Instance variable" or "Object Variable"

## Static Property / Method
- It is also called class property/ method
- Static property/ method does not create instance.
- There might occur some errors when trying to call from instance variables. 

## Built In Object
- Global: provide means to access basic Javascript functions.
- Object
- Array
- MAP/WeakMAP : deal with array consist of key/value.
- Set/WeakSet : Provide means to manage distinct sets.
- String
- Boolean 
- Number
- Function
- Symbol
- Math
- Date
- RegExp : provides functions related to regular expressions
- Error/XxxxxError : managing error info

  - For those basic Data types, it is better not to use "new".
