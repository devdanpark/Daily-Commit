# Object 
## Object = Property + Method
- Object can be defined as a bowl that contains diverse functions to control data.

## New operator
- Reproducing an object is creating "instance"
- To make an object as an instance, we use "new" operator

``` javascript
var obj = new nObj([...])
```
## Constructor
- When initializing an object, there must be method that has the same name as the object. This initialization method is called "constructor"
- A created instance is stored at a variable. Then, the variable can be considered as an object. The variable can be called as "Instance variable" or "Object Variable"
