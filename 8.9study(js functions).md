## Functions

The best thing about JS is its implementation of functions. It got almost everything right. But, as you should expect with JS, it did not get everything right.

### Function Objects
Functions in JS are objects. 
Every function object is also created with a prototype property.
Its value is an object with a constructor property whose value is the function. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to functions, and functions can be returned from functions. Also, since functions are objects, functions can have methods. 

### Function Literal

```javascript
// Create a variable called add and store a function
// in it that adds two numbers.
var add = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

```
### Invocation
The "this" parameter is very important in OOP, and its value is determined by the invocation pattern.

### The Method Invocation Pattern

```javascript
//Create myObject. It has avalue and an increment
//method. The increment method takes an optional parameter.
//If the argument is not a number, then 1 is used as the default.

var myObject = {
    value: 0,
    increment: function (inc) {
        this.value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
    }
};

```
A method can use "this" to access the object so that it can retrive values from the object or modify the object.

If the method defines a variable and assigns it the value of this, the inner function will have acess to this through that variable. By convention, the name of that variable is that:

```javascript
//Argument myObject with a double method.

myObject.double = function () {
    var that = this; // workaround
    var helper = function () {
        that.value = add(that.value, that.value)
    };
    helper(); //invoke helper as a function
};
//invoke double as a method
myObject.double();
document.writeln(myObject.getValue()); //
```
### The Constructor Invocation Pattern
Javascript is a prototypal inheritance language.
This means that objects can inherit properties directly from other objects. (class-free language)
If a function is invoked with a new prefix, a new object will be created with a hidden link to the value of the function's prototype member, and this will be bound to the new object.

```javascript
//Create a constructor function called Quo.
//It makes an object with a status property.

var Quo = function (string) {
    this.status = string;
};
//give all instances of Quo a public method
//called get_status.
Quo.prototype.get_status = function () {
    return this.status;
};
//Make an instance of Quo.
var myQuo = new Quo("confused");
document.writeln(myQuo.get_status()); //confused

```
functions with "new" are called as constructors. 
Constructor without "new" can cause a cmopile-time or running warning.

### Arugments
An array gives the function acess to all of the arguments that were supplied with the invocation, including excess arguments that were not assigned to parameters. 

```javascript
//Make a function that adds a lot of stuff.
//Note that defining the variable sum inside of the function does not interfere with the sum defined outside of the function. The function only sees the inner one.

var sum = function () {
    var i, sum = 0;
    for(i = 0; i < arguments.length; i += 1){
        sum += arguments[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
document.writeln(sum(4,8,1,3,3,4));
```
Owing to a design error, argument is not really an array. It is an array-like object.

### RETURN
- when retrun is executed, the function returns immediately without executing the remainig statements.
- A function always returns a value. If not, undefined is returned.

### EXCEPTION
- "throw" interrupts exectuion of the function.
- It should be given an exception objectcontatnning a name property that identifies the type of the exception. 

```javascript
//Make a try_it function that calls the new add function incorrectly.

var try_it = function() {
    try {
        add("seven");
    } catch(e) {
        document.writeln(e.name + ':' + e.message);
    }
}
try_it();
```

### Augumenting Types
Javascript allows the basic types of the language to be augmeted. By augumenting Function.prototype, we can make a method available to all functions: 

```javascript
Function.prototype.method = function(name, func) {
    this.prototype[name] = func;
    return this;
};
```
