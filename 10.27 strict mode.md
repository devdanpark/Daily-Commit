# strict mode
## Main limit of strict mode
- variables
  - Do not ommit 'var'
  - do not repeat the name of property and factor.
  - do not substitute undefined/null

- Command
  - do not use 'with' command
  - do not access arguments.callee property.
  - do not spread a varaible declared by eval to surrounding scope.

- Etc
  - 'this' in a function does not refer to global object(it becomes undefined)

### By using strict mode, there are some advantages.
- Faster than non-strict mode code

## Activate Strict Mode
- putting 'use strict'; 
- "usestrict" is also possible
- Strict mode is supported by IE 10 above.
