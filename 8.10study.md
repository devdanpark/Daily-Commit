## Recursion
A recursive function is a function that calls itself either directly or indirectly.

``` javascript
var hanoi = function (disc, src, aux, dst) {
    if(disc > 0) {
        hanoi(disc -1, src, dst, aux);
        document.writeln('Move disc' + disc + 'from' + src + 'to' + dst);
        hanoi(disc -1, aux. src, dst);
    }
};
hanoi(3, 'Src', 'Aux', 'Dst');
```

``` javascript
//Define a walk_the_Dom function that visits every 
//node of the tree in HTML source order, starting 
//from some given node. It invokes a function, 
//passing it each node in turn. walk_the_Dom calls 
//itself to process each of the child nodes.
var walk_the_Dom = function walk(node, func) {
    func(node);
    node = node.firstCHild;
    while(node) {
        walk(node, func);
        node = node.nextSibling;
    }
};
```

## Scope
``` javascript
var foo = function () {
    var a = 3, b = 5;

    var bar = function () {
        var b = 7, c = 11;
    //At this point, a is 3, b is 7, and c is 11
        a += b + c;
    //At this point, a is 21, b is 7, c is 11
    };
    //At this point, a is 3, b is 5, and c is not defined.
    bar();
  //At this point, a is 21, b is 5  
}
```
- Javascript does not have a function scope. 
- This means that the parameters and variables defined in a function are not visible outside of the function, and a variable defined anywhere within a function is visible everywhere within the function.
